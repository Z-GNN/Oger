# Oger

## DR;TL
The Oger toolbox is no longer available or maintained.
I copy/pasted the version of the code I was using for my papers (mid-june 2012), which is probably close to the latest version ever done.

## Why do I provide the Oger toolbox?
I am not the author of this toolbox, but I participated (as a PhD student) to the european Organic FP7 project which develpped it.
As I previously developped code using this toolbox (that is published as supplementary material of a [PLoS ONE paper]()) I want to that my code is still executable today with the original toolbox.

Thus I provide the original code available with the original license (LGPL).


### Original paper describing the toolbox
The original paper describing Oger is [available here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262356589_Oger_Modular_Learning_Architectures_For_Large-Scale_Sequential_Processing).

Abstract of this paper:
    Oger (OrGanic Environment for Reservoir computing) is a Python toolbox for building, training and evaluating modular learning architectures on large data sets. It builds on MDP for its modularity, and adds processing of sequential data sets, gradient descent training, several crossvalidation schemes and parallel parameter optimization methods. Additionally, several learning algorithms are implemented, such as different reservoir implementations (both sigmoid and spiking), ridge regression, conditional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) and others, including GPU accelerated versions. Oger is released under the GNU LGPL.
