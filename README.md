# Oger

## DR;TL
Oger is a toolbox mainly used for Reservoir Computing neural networks, such as Echo State Networks (ESN) and Liquid State Machines (LSM).

It was developped during the European FP7 Organic project (2009-2012) focused on Reservoir Computing.

The Oger toolbox is no longer available or maintained.

I provide the original code available with the original license (LGPL).


## Why do I provide the Oger toolbox?
I am not the author of this toolbox, but I participated (as a PhD student) to the european Organic FP7 project which develpped it.
As I previously developped code using this toolbox (that is published as supplementary material of a [PLoS ONE paper]()) I want to that my code is still executable today with the original toolbox.

That is why I copy/pasted the version of the code I was using for my papers (mid-june 2012), which is probably close to the latest version ever done.

## Original paper describing the toolbox
The original paper describing Oger is [available here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262356589_Oger_Modular_Learning_Architectures_For_Large-Scale_Sequential_Processing).

**Abstract**

    Oger (OrGanic Environment for Reservoir computing) is a Python toolbox for building, training and evaluating modular learning architectures on large data sets. It builds on MDP for its modularity, and adds processing of sequential data sets, gradient descent training, several crossvalidation schemes and parallel parameter optimization methods. Additionally, several learning algorithms are implemented, such as different reservoir implementations (both sigmoid and spiking), ridge regression, conditional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) and others, including GPU accelerated versions. Oger is released under the GNU LGPL.
